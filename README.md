# Hello and thank you for visiting my GitHub 

This README.md file is a quick introduction to my repos.

1. [gazerR](https://github.com/andy0682/gazeR)
  * This repo shows how to develop a R-Package with DevOps best practices.
  * First I created, as an example, a Package that clusters sensor data (eye-tracking recordings) with a Density-Base Clustering algorithm.
  * The R-Package documentation (Vignets) was created with the [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) library. 
  * Unit Testing was implemented with the [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org) library. 
  * CI/CD was implemented with [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com).
  * During the whole implementation process the [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org) and [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org) libraries.
    
2. [GazeR-demo](https://github.com/andy0682/GazeR-demo)
  *  This repo shows how to use the gazeR Package.
     
3. [test_notebook](https://github.com/andy0682/test_notebook)
  * This is a [Jupyther notebook](https://github.com/andy0682/test_notebook/blob/main/BQconnect.ipynb) showing how to use the Google BigQuery API with Python.

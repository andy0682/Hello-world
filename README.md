# Hello and thank you for visiting my Github 

This README.md file was meant to be a quick introduction of myself and my repos.
However, it will be soon replaced by a GitHub personal Web Page.

For the moment, there are only two repos in development: 

* gazerR: This repo contains the code for an R package I am developping.
* gazeR-demo: A short Jupyther Notebook (gazeR_demo.ipynb) showing how to use the gazer Package.
* test_notebook: This is a Jupyther notebook (BQconnect.ipynb) showing how to use the Google BigQuery API with Python.

# Hello, and thank you for visiting my Github 

This README.md file was meant to be a quick introduction of myself and my repos.
However, it will be soon replaced by a GitHub personal Web Page.

For the moment, there are only two repos in development:

* gazerR: This repo contains the code for an R package I am developping.
* test_notebook: This is a jupyther notebook that shows how to use the Google BigQuery API.
